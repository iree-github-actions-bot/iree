# Using IREE
{: .no_toc }

This section contains information for using IREE as a dependency project for running ML models. We plan to provide C APIs for various IREE components and build Python/Java/etc. bindings on top of C APIs. At the moment IREE is still under active development so they are not fully designed yet; we expect to add more contains gradually.
