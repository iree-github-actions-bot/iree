# TensorFlow Coverage
{: .no_toc }


IREE has three backend
[targets](https://github.com/google/iree/tree/main/iree/compiler/Dialect/HAL/Target):
`vmla`, `llvm-ir` and `vulkan-spirv`. We also test TFLite in our infrastructure
for benchmarking purposes.
The coverage tables in this section are automatically generated from IREE's
test suites.
